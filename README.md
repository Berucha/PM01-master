# PM01: Site visit

For Project Milestone 01, schedule a site visit with your service learning customer (the community partner you will be working for). The goal of the site visit is to learn more about the organization you will be working with. To truly develop a software application for your customer, you must understand the customer's work, including the people they work with (their customers), the product or service they are producing, and the purpose of the work. 

## Deliverables

Push to this repository by Friday, January 17th with:

1. The date you and your customer agree to the visit. The date you visit does not have to be before Friday, just an agreed upon date by Friday. 
2. A list of 5 questions you plan to ask your customer during this visit. 
3. The name(s) of the person(s) you will be meeting.
4. The location of the visit. 

### GFWC Berea Women's Club

SITE VISIT
Our team was able to visit the site the day we were given the assignment. The Berea Women's Club meet the second Monday of every month. The meeting mainly consisted of discussions regarding a major annual event they host. Therefore, we did not have much opportunity to talk about the database and their expectations. However, our main contact within the club, Sarah Heggen, agreed to meet with us to discuss specifics. 

FIRST MEETING
Mrs. Heggen agreed to meet with us Friday, Jan 17 in our Database Systems classroom. 
During this meeting, we plan on discussing the following 5 questions:
    1) What does this system look like to you?
    2) What are the NEEDS for the system? 
    3) What are the WANTS for the system?
    4) In what ways do you hope this system will benefit your organization?
    5) What are your expectations from us as a group for this semester?
